<h1>socialmedia</h1>
<p>The term social in regard to media suggests
 that platforms are user-centric and enable communal
activity.<br> As such, social media can be viewed
 as online facilitators or enhancers of human networksâ€”webs
 of individuals who enhance social connectivity.</p>

<h2>history of socialmedia</h2>
<p/>The PLATO system was launched in 1960 after being developed at the University of Illinois and
 subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation.<br> It offered early forms of social media features 
with 1973-era innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; <br>
Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowdsourced online newspaper, and blog and Access Lists,
 enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users,<br>
for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers.
